# Welcome to the Pages of Guanfu Liu (刘观福)

## A brief introduction of myself
I am Guanfu Liu (刘观福). You can contact me at liugf6@mail2.sysu.edu.cn (will expire on about 31th July 2022 because I will go for further study in Tsinghua University) or liugfphy@163.com.


I love astronomy and physics. I tend to solve all the scientific problems by using Python and Fortran. And I am open to learn any new effective programming language.

## My research interests
### I am doing some researches in exoplanets, especially in the simulation of the dynamical tides of Super-Earths.
### I also show some interests in plasma lensing.
### My resaerch interests are very diverse.


## Presentations are listed in the following
[16 October 2021](https://liuguanfu1120.github.io/Presentations/Dynamical_tides_SE.pdf) Dynamical tides affect the evolution timescale of super-Earth

[30 November 2021](https://liuguanfu1120.github.io/Presentations/Plasma_lensing.pdf) Paper Guide: Bias in apparent dispersion measure due to de-magnification of plasma lensing on background radio sources
